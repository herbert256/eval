# Calling the AI App

Eval's sender-side guide to `com.ai.ACTION_NEW_REPORT`.

Companion: [AI repo — doc/custom-intent.md](../ai/doc/custom-intent.md)
([GitHub](https://github.com/herbert256/ai/blob/master/doc/custom-intent.md)).
The local link assumes sibling `eval` and `ai` checkouts. Keep the shared
contract and examples between the marked comments identical in both files
when either side changes. The implementation notes below are repo-specific.

<!-- BEGIN SHARED AI INTENT CONTRACT -->
## Intent contract

Send action `com.ai.ACTION_NEW_REPORT` restricted to package `com.ai`.
This is separate from Android's `ACTION_SEND` share-sheet flow.

| String extra | Requirement | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Optional | Report title; generation uses `AI Report` when the title is blank. |
| `instructions` | Required for Eval's current handoff | Paired instruction/data tags and standalone control flags. AI calls this state `externalInstructions` internally; the actual extra key is **`instructions`**. |
| `prompt` | Optional | Explicit question, for other/older callers. It can be omitted when `instructions` is present. |
| `system` | Optional | Literal system-prompt text, for other/older callers. It is a fallback below configured worker/provider/report prompts. |

**Eval currently sends only `title` and `instructions`.** It stores named
instruction entries; prompts, system prompts, parameter presets and worker
configurations belong to the AI app. Do not send an extra named
`externalInstructions`.

A bare `prompt` without instructions pre-fills the New Report editor.
Instruction-bearing requests first resolve their saved definitions, then
show **External request** confirmation. They never generate before that
confirmation. When no explicit prompt, named default or Agent/Flock/Swarm
selection supplies the question, AI opens its saved-prompt picker first.

For older callers, `prompt` can contain `-- end prompt --`: text before the
marker is the question and text after it is instructions. A supplied
`instructions` extra takes precedence over this split, even when empty.

## Instruction tags

Use paired tags for values and standalone tags for flags. Use lowercase
control tags as shown; the three new saved-definition selectors also accept
uppercase/mixed-case tag names.

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<system>Name</system>` | Select a saved **System prompt** as the report-level override for all selected models. |
| `<parameters>Name</parameters>` | Select a saved **Parameters** preset as the report-level generation settings. |
| `<default>Name</default>` | Select a saved **Default prompt** for every selected model when no explicit question is present, ahead of worker defaults. Works with bare models too. |
| `<systemprompt>Name</systemprompt>` | Older alias for selecting a saved system prompt; `<system>` wins when both are present. |
| `<prompt>Name</prompt>` | Select an existing Example Prompt or eligible Internal Prompt, by ID or unique name. This is a different catalog from Default prompts. |
| `<agent>Name</agent>` | Select a configured Agent by name; repeatable. |
| `<flock>Name</flock>` | Select a configured Flock by name; repeatable. |
| `<swarm>Name</swarm>` | Select a configured Swarm by name; repeatable. |
| `<model>Provider/model-id</model>` | Select a model directly; repeatable. The first slash separates provider from model, so the model ID may contain more slashes. |
| `<type>Classic</type>` / `<type>Table</type>` | Choose the report format. |
| `<open>content</open>` / `<close>content</close>` | Opening/closing report presentation, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. |
| `<next>View</next>` | Completion action: `View`, `Share`, `Browser` or `Email`. `Email` uses AI's configured default email address. |
| `<email>recipient@example.com</email>` | Open the email chooser with the completed HTML report attached and the recipient filled in. This does not silently send email. |
| `<edit>` | After confirmation, open New Report for editing; a named default is pre-filled for editing when no explicit question was supplied. |
| `<select>` | After confirmation, open model selection rather than immediately generating. |
| `<return>` | Finish the AI activity after the requested email/next action; no report data is returned as an Android activity result. |
| `<name>value</name>` | Supply a custom value for matching `@name@` placeholders in templates. |

Names in `<system>`, `<parameters>` and `<default>` are trimmed and matched
ignoring case. Stable definition IDs also work and take priority over name
matches. XML-escape names containing special characters, for example
`Research &amp; writing`. Missing, ambiguous or empty names, and an empty
saved default prompt, are shown on confirmation and disable continuation.
An unresolved legacy `<prompt>` reference instead opens the saved-prompt
picker.

Prompt precedence is: a template selected with `<prompt>` (when supplied),
otherwise explicit `prompt` text, then `<default>`, then the selected
workers' assigned defaults. Without a named default, a selected Flock falls
back to its members' Agent defaults; directly selected Agents use their own
defaults, and Swarm members use their Swarm's default. Bare models have no
worker default.

`<system>` / `<systemprompt>` set the report-level system choice, above
worker/provider defaults, the literal `system` extra and system text inside
a Parameters preset. The parameter preset applies above worker/provider
parameter defaults. Users can change report-level choices in report setup.
Saved definitions and worker assignments are unchanged by a request.
Generation captures the resolved prompt and parameters for retry/regenerate.

After confirmation, immediate generation requires a `<type>`, at least one
worker/model source, and neither `<edit>` nor `<select>`. Otherwise the user
continues through editing/selection. A valid model selection, prompt and
provider configuration are still required. Completion actions run only after
generation; Share and Email open Android choosers, and Browser opens an HTML
viewer.

## Context and placeholder substitution

There are two stages:

1. **Eval prepares instructions.** In its saved instruction text, Eval
   expands the exact uppercase tokens `@FEN@`, `@COLOR@`, `@SERVER@`,
   `@PLAYER@`, `@PGN@`, `@BOARD@` and `@DATE@` once. `@DATE@` uses local
   `yyyy-MM-dd`. Other custom tokens are left for AI. Eval then appends all
   six context tags below, in order, including empty values.
2. **AI resolves its templates.** Matching `@name@` placeholders in system
   and default prompts use entries from the received instructions, ignoring
   case. For example, `<topic>Amsterdam</topic>` supplies both `@topic@` and
   `@TOPIC@`. AI also expands context in selected legacy saved prompts and
   opening/closing presentation.

| Eval-appended tag | Value |
|---|---|
| `<fen>…</fen>` | Current position, including an explored variation. |
| `<color>…</color>` | `White` or `Black`, from the FEN's side to move. |
| `<server>…</server>` | `lichess.org` when known, otherwise empty. |
| `<player>…</player>` | Side-to-move player's name for a position report; selected player for a profile report. May be empty when unknown. |
| `<pgn>…</pgn>` | Available game PGN; the separate FEN is authoritative for the current position. |
| `<board>…</board>` | Generated board HTML/JavaScript. |

A player-only request sends empty `fen`, `color`, `pgn` and `board`; it does
not reuse the last opened position. Eval XML-escapes the five plain fields
(`&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&#39;`); `board` is raw markup. Its
inline token expansion in the saved instruction text inserts values as-is;
use the appended fields for plain model context.

AI decodes plain entry values once and preserves raw `open`, `close` and
`board` bodies. Custom names start with a letter or underscore and may also
contain digits, dots, hyphens and colons. Values may span lines and retain
whitespace. An empty entry replaces its token with empty text; when data
entries repeat, the last value is used. Eval's appended context therefore
wins over an earlier duplicate context entry. Use each saved-definition
selector once; the first selector of each kind is read for routing.

System/default substitution is a single pass: tokens inside an inserted
value remain literal. Other unmatched tokens remain unchanged, apart from
existing default-prompt built-ins such as `@MODEL@`, `@PROVIDER@`, `@AGENT@`
and `@DATE@` when no matching external entry overrides them. Eval does not
append a `date` field automatically: add `<date>@DATE@</date>` to its saved
instructions to give saved system and default templates the same explicit
date value.

Keep `@BOARD@` in `<open>`/`<close>` for presentation. A system or default
template that explicitly uses `@BOARD@` receives that raw value like any
other named entry; caller-supplied normal prompts and the legacy saved-prompt
path omit the board token. Data and presentation bodies are removed before
interpreting commands, so `<select>` or `<email>` inside such a body is data.

HTML opening/closing bodies are inserted verbatim, including CSS, scripts
and event handlers, in Complete/Short HTML and the zipped HTML index. They
run in the in-app HTML preview and a browser opening the export. Reports
with either field have an **HTML** tile in **View**. Text-only presentation
keeps Markdown formatting; when supplying HTML, write the whole body as
HTML. The literal `</open>` / `</close>` delimiter ends its body, including
when written inside a JavaScript string.

## Examples

The definition and worker names below are examples: create them in AI first
or substitute names/IDs that already exist. Eval automatically appends its
six context tags; do not paste a fixed FEN or duplicate those tags into an
Eval instruction entry.

### 1. Eval position report with all three named selections

Create these definitions in AI:

| Kind / name | Example contents |
|---|---|
| System prompt **Chess coach** | `You are a chess coach. Respond in @language@. Report date: @date@.` |
| Parameters **Careful analysis** | Temperature `0.2`, max tokens `2048` (choose a model supporting them). |
| Default prompt **Analyse a position** | `Analyse @fen@ for @color@. Player: @player@. Explain plans and candidate moves.` |

Save this instruction text in Eval:

```xml
<system>Chess coach</system>
<parameters>Careful analysis</parameters>
<default>Analyse a position</default>
<language>English</language>
<date>@DATE@</date>
<type>Classic</type>
<select>
<next>View</next>
<open>@BOARD@</open>
```

Eval inserts the current date and board, appends the current position and
player fields, and sends only `title` and `instructions`. AI shows the
expanded default/system prompts on confirmation, then model selection and
report setup. The named default applies even to a directly selected model.
The user starts generation; completion opens the report view.

### 2. Use a Flock's defaults and generate after confirmation

The AI Flock **Chess analysts** must exist and resolve a non-empty default
prompt for every member. Save in Eval:

```xml
<flock>Chess analysts</flock>
<type>Classic</type>
<next>View</next>
<open>@BOARD@</open>
```

There is no `<select>` or `<edit>`, so AI's confirmation button is
**Generate**. No API calls start before the user confirms. Each member uses
its resolved worker default and the received position context.

### 3. Eval player-only report

Create a Default prompt named **Player profile** with this text:

```text
Summarize the playing style of @player@ on @server@. State what cannot be
inferred from the supplied information.
```

Save this instruction entry in Eval:

```xml
<system>Chess coach</system>
<default>Player profile</default>
<language>English</language>
<date>@DATE@</date>
<type>Classic</type>
<select>
```

For a synthetic player `ExamplePlayer` on `lichess.org`, AI resolves the
question to `Summarize the playing style of ExamplePlayer on lichess.org…`.
The position-related fields are empty. No old FEN or board is included.

### 4. Another Android caller: complete named-template request

Create System prompt **Short answers** (`Answer in @language@.`), Parameters
**Concise** (max tokens `512`), and Default prompt **City summary**
(`Describe @topic@ in three sentences.`) in AI. From an Android Activity:

```kotlin
import android.app.Activity
import android.content.ActivityNotFoundException
import android.content.Intent
import android.widget.Toast

fun Activity.openCityReport() {
    val instructions = """
        <system>Short answers</system>
        <parameters>Concise</parameters>
        <default>City summary</default>
        <topic>Amsterdam</topic>
        <language>Dutch</language>
        <type>Classic</type>
        <select>
    """.trimIndent()
    val request = Intent("com.ai.ACTION_NEW_REPORT")
        .setPackage("com.ai")
        .putExtra("title", "Amsterdam summary")
        .putExtra("instructions", instructions)
    try {
        startActivity(request)
    } catch (_: ActivityNotFoundException) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "Install the AI app first", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}
```

AI previews `Answer in Dutch.` and `Describe Amsterdam in three sentences.`.
The user confirms, selects models and generates. No `prompt`, literal
`system` or `externalInstructions` extra is needed. If the caller adds
`.putExtra("prompt", "Compare Amsterdam and Utrecht.")`, that explicit
question takes precedence over **City summary**.

### 5. Missing names and literal values

```xml
<system>System that does not exist</system>
<parameters>Concise</parameters>
<default>City summary</default>
<topic>Amsterdam &amp; Utrecht</topic>
<language></language>
<literal>@topic@</literal>
<select>
```

Assuming only the system name is missing, AI shows
`System prompt not found: System that does not exist` and disables
continuation. Correct the name and resend. Once resolved, `@topic@` becomes
`Amsterdam & Utrecht`, `@language@` becomes empty, and `@literal@` becomes the
literal text `@topic@` in system/default templates. An unmatched `@unknown@`
stays unchanged.

## Eval implementation

- [`AiAppLauncher.kt`](app/src/main/java/com/eval/ui/AiAppLauncher.kt)
  implements `launchAiReport(context, entry, reportContext)`,
  `buildInstructions` and board HTML generation. It sends only `title` and
  `instructions`, restricted to package `com.ai`.
- [`AiSettingsModels.kt`](app/src/main/java/com/eval/ui/AiSettingsModels.kt)
  defines `AiInstructionEntry(id, name, instructions)` and
  `AiReportContext(title, fen, color, server, player, pgn, board)`.
- [`GameViewModel.kt`](app/src/main/java/com/eval/ui/GameViewModel.kt)
  captures the current position or selected player's context and stages the
  instruction choice. [`GameScreen.kt`](app/src/main/java/com/eval/ui/GameScreen.kt)
  shows that chooser before launching AI.
- [`SettingsScreen.kt`](app/src/main/java/com/eval/ui/SettingsScreen.kt)
  manages named entries under Settings → AI Instructions.
- [`SettingsPreferences.kt`](app/src/main/java/com/eval/ui/SettingsPreferences.kt)
  stores `ai_instructions_list`; typed settings schema v3 uses
  `aiInstructions`. Migration retains old IDs, names and instructions and
  converts a legacy email field to an `<email>` instruction. Old prompt and
  system-prompt text is not part of active Eval instruction storage.
- [`AndroidManifest.xml`](app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) declares package
  visibility queries for `com.ai` and the custom action, used by
  `resolveActivity`/the installed-app check.

The current launcher checks that AI can handle the intent and returns
`false` with a toast when unavailable. It also supports an optional pinned
signing-certificate fingerprint; the current empty constant leaves pinning
disabled. Model/API configuration and all report generation belong to AI.

Existing Eval call sites use the instruction-entry API, not the obsolete
`launchAiReport(context, title, prompt, system, instructions)` signature.
For example, from an Activity inside Eval:

```kotlin
val entry = AiInstructionEntry(
    name = "Position report",
    instructions = """
        <system>Chess coach</system>
        <parameters>Careful analysis</parameters>
        <default>Analyse a position</default>
        <language>English</language>
        <date>@DATE@</date>
        <type>Classic</type><select><next>View</next>
        <open>@BOARD@</open>
    """.trimIndent()
)
val position = AiAppLauncher.gameContext(
    fen = "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1",
    whiteName = "ExampleWhite",
    blackName = "ExampleBlack",
    server = "lichess.org",
    pgn = "*"
)
AiAppLauncher.launchAiReport(this, entry, position)
```

The position values here are synthetic examples; production call sites use
the live `GameViewModel` snapshot. Both position and player requests require
the user to select a named instruction entry.
